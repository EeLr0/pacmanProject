    while not stack.isEmpty:
        if problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState):
            return
        path = [*path, stack.pop()]
        child = problem.getSuccessors(path[i])
        if child not in visited and problem.getSuccessors(child) != None:
            visited = [*visited, child.]
            path = [*path, child]
            stack.push(child)
            i+=1
        elif child not in visited and problem.getSuccessors(child) == None:
            visited = [*visited, child]
        
    return path
